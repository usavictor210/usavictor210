Removed old contents as it was quite embarrassing. If you care that much you can still review the history to see what it used to be. But pretty much the gist remains the same.
I no longer have a twitch account formerly under the username of usavictor1. 
In an effort to distance myself from a large part of gaming I have decided it was a reasonable decision to delete the account.
I haven't been interested in using Twitch and haven't been thinking about it for a while, and all of the clips I used to have may not exist anymore. So the point is, why bother?

Maybe I will recreate one in the far future, but this is not planned and it is uncertain whether Twitch will still be operational within my lifetime.
Therefore, this is goodbye. Goodbye to a streaming platform of chaos and misfortune.
