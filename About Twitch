I've had my Twitch account ever since I was a little kid.
The inception of Twitch Plays Pokemon was fascinating to me. These interactive streams are what brought me in to the website.
However, I've never decided to go much deeper than that.

Not until I started watching VTubers.
Twitch has a massive platform of them; it is hard to not find one when you scroll these days.
However, I no longer feel in the position to partake in these matters any more.

From the moment this document has been posted, I have already been contemplating deletion.
It would not matter anyway; my account was doomed from the start.
I had created the account when I was under 13. Changing the date of birth now would be a death sentence.
Despite having partaken in the early days of the fallenshadow twitch community, I have grown distant from it.

Perhaps this is what happens when you touch grass. You realize the world is no longer about what happens on the internet.

This is where the journey ends for me.

An action like this is necessary. I'm no longer the gamer that I once was 10 years ago.
Now I may understand how Kevin Darxide feels. If I have messed up your name, I am deeply sorry.
You may think this is ridiculous, but this has been something on my mind for a while now.
I've been waiting for the day when I can finally move on.

I'm strong enough now.

I don't need a viking helmet anymore.
