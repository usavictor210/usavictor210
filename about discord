Discord has become more of a detriment to me. This unhealthy issue started during 2021 where I was at home 24 hours a day because of covid restrictions.
Slowly I've come to realize that while I've made many friends on Discord, it has taken a toll on my mental health and I kind of feel depressed sometimes
Therefore, I feel like using Discord is no longer good for my well-being at this time.

I don't want to go through that much pain again, and I feel like I have become a lot worse. I have therefore decided to take the initative to
improve myself. I won't be going on Discord as much as I used to. You may message me on element (limelock, @usavictor:matrix.org) if you want to send anything
that is regarding me and the projects that I am involved in. I may still be active on the internet. However, I will most likely not be active on Discord,
not until conditions improve to a stable point.

I hope this can help me relieve a lot of burdens that I have to be a better person.
As of now, no YouTube uploads are planned. I probably won't play Roblox again for a long time. Maybe expect a few sporadic videos if I'm feeling generous.
But, at this point, I am unsure of what to do. Maybe the internet is too much for me to handle. Perhaps I should've realized this years ago.

I want to continue working on some projects, however, it may not be known for a long time. If I finish some, it will be announced on my YouTube at one point.
I hope I feel better one day when this is over.
