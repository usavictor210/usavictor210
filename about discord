I have changed a lot of things about this document.
Long story short, I have left Discord indefinitely until I get better.
I'm going to try my best to improve my real life matters first before I try to do anything else.
The previous version felt too emotional. You may view the old version if you want.
Essentially, I was becoming aware that Discord was a major distraction.
YouTube is another one of those major distractions. But I am starting to try my best to stop getting distracted.

I feel a little more hopeful about this now. Someday, I will come back.
