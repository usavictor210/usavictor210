Removed old contents as they were outdated. If you still care you may check the history of this file to see what it used to be.
In an effort to distance myself from gaming I have decided not to use Discord for the time being, except under extremely special circumstances.
I've done this multiple times in the past, but I considered myself too much of a coward to stop. This time, it's different.
Quitting is only as good as your actions and intentions. As I never learned to find better avenues to replace my old habits, they kept coming back.
But this is the last straw. I've already taken measures to make sure I start to disconnect my former reasons for uses of Discord.

Thus development will remain silent until I decide to push. You might see some github projects as dead until I work on them again.
I intend to get back to them as soon as I feel more comfortable doing so.

If you really need to contact me you should probably email me. I think I'll have to set up my home page now to be able to let this happen easily.
