Hello, I have a bunch of things on my mind right now but to make things short I just haven't felt like going back on Discord for a while. I'm trying to write this on my github page so I can hopefully get more exposure but I don't think
most people will be able to see this as they are ironically caught up in all sort of other things in their lives, which includes Discord. Unfortunately I haven't felt like doing a lot of game development programming either. I've been
trying to reflect on parts of my life and I'm not sure how I feel about things right now. This is not to say that I will disappear into the endless depths of the void once again, but there's something I feel I have avoided for far
too long. So I need to deal with life first, and a whole lot of other things. I will move this to a github page later; for now I will leave this here.

A lot of things are on hold; they're not discontinued but I don't have motivation to work on more than a few projects at once right now. Sorry

My work is a bit inconsistent.
